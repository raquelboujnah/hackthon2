Eyal and Meryl
Great job! Your work is clear and easy to understand. 
You knew how to use all the features and topics we learned in class, which is impressive.
I would raise only one point:
I noticed that the handleSearchInput function was copied and pasted three times. 
Instead, you could have simply imported the function to avoid redundancy.
Keep up the good work!
